## <a id="features"></a> Key Features

Mulesoft Anypoint Platform Service Brokers for PCF provides the following key features:

* Integrates PCF with the Anypoint [Runtime Manager](https://docs.mulesoft.com/runtime-manager/) to track and manage Mule apps deployed to PCF.

* Mediates between PCF and the Anypoint [API Manager](https://docs.mulesoft.com/api-manager/) to track and manage registered APIs.

* Includes [Anypoint Exchange](https://docs.mulesoft.com/mule-fundamentals/v/3.8/anypoint-exchange), where your organization can discover and share assets for use and reuse throughout your integrations.

When you install the tile, it installs these service brokers:

* Runtime Manager Service Broker
* API Gateway Manager Service Broker
* Anypoint Metering Service Broker 

See [Service Brokers](#service-brokers) for a description of each of these. 
The tile also deploys the Anypoint Metering application. This application exposes the PCF Metering API. 
For information on using this API, see [To Access Usage Data with the PCF Metering API](https://docs.mulesoft.com/anypoint-private-cloud/v/1.5/pcf-metering).

During installation, the Anypoint Platform Service Brokers for PCF tile creates a new PCF org 
called `anypoint-sb-org` where the service brokers and application are installed.	

### <a id="service-brokers"></a>Anypoint Platform Service Brokers

Anypoint Platform Service Brokers for PCF uses multiple service brokers to enable you to integrate the Anypoint Platform with PCF.

#### <a id="rmsb"></a> Runtime Manager Service Broker

The Runtime Manager Service Broker exposes PCF as a deployment target within the Anypoint Runtime Manager and 
lets you deploy Mule applications to PCF.

#### <a id="apigsb"></a> API Gateway Manager Service Broker

The API Gateway Manager lets you create and deploy a Mule API proxy that intercepts traffic to a non-Mule app running on PCF. 
This lets you use the Mulesoft interface to apply policies over the API and the PCF interface to view usage and policy metrics.
See [Deploy a Proxy](https://docs.mulesoft.com/api-manager/setting-up-an-api-proxy).

#### <a id="metering"></a> Anypoint Metering Service Broker 

The Anypoint Metering Service Broker provides an API that enables you to view usage metrics for Mule applications deployed to PCF. 
You can view usage metrics for production, pre-production, staging, and development environments.
